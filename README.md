# Lumen

LUMEN is a Web3-powered launchpad for tokenized renewable energy assets, enabling ESG-aligned investments in large-scale solar, wind, and other clean energy projects. Each initiative is structured through a dedicated SPV, with ownership or revenue rights represented as NFTs or SFPs under EU-compliant frameworks. Investors can participate from €500, benefiting from on-chain transparency, automated profit distribution, and secondary market liquidity under DLT Pilot principles. By merging tokenization-as-a-service, compliance-by-design, and scalable governance, LUMEN bridges traditional project finance with decentralized capital markets, accelerating global access to renewable infrastructure financing.

## Tech Stack

 • DLT Layer: Hedera Hashgraph – low-energy, high-throughput DLT ensuring immutable, cost-efficient transactions.
 • ESG Verification: Hedera Guardian – open-source ESG framework for verifiable sustainability claims and tokenized environmental assets.
 • Smart Contracts & Tokenization: Solidity & Hedera Token Service for NFT/SFT-based representation of SPV shares or SFPs, compliant with EU frameworks.
 • Compliance Layer: Integration with MGA for KYC/AML and legal validation of digital securities.
 • SPV Management: API-connected legal entities for each renewable project, automating profit distribution and governance.
 • Marketplace & UI: React + Next.js frontend, integrated with Hedera SDK, IPFS for asset storage, and WalletConnect.
 • Analytics & Impact Tracking: On-chain ESG metrics, DLT Pilot Regime reporting dashboards, and Guardian-issued attestations.

## Hedera Hackathon Track

Sustainability & Green Tech – LUMEN leverages Hedera Guardian, an open-source, blockchain-based ESG framework, to tokenize and manage verifiable sustainability assets. Guardian embeds auditable ESG claims directly into the lifecycle of each renewable energy project (solar, wind, and beyond), ensuring immutable proof of impact and alignment with global sustainability standards. This capability is vital to LUMEN’s mission: transforming environmental data into verifiable, tradable digital assets that enable investors to measure, prove, and enhance their contribution to decarbonization. By embedding Guardian at the protocol level, LUMEN ensures trust, transparency, and regulatory-grade compliance for ESG-linked investments.
